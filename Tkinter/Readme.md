Tkinter is a graphical user interface(GUI) library for python. It is a standard library that is pre-installed with most Python distributions. Tkinter is a cross-plataform library, which means it can be used to create GUI applications for Windows, macOS and Linux. 

To create a GUI application with Tkinter, we need to follow these steps:

1. Import the Tkinter library
2. Create the main window of the GUI application
3. Add one or more widget to the GUI application
4. Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user. 

The label in the code is a Tkinter widget. The label widget is used to display the text "hello, world". 

Labels are a very common type of widget in GUI applications, They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

3. Une the place() mehod to place widgets at specific coordinates in the main window
4. Use the mainloop() method to start the main event loop
